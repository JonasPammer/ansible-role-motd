[[requirements]]
== 📌 Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.


The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.


[[variables]]
== 📜 Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]
----
motd_type: [OS-specific for v1, see TODO in setup-update-motd.yml]
----
A MOTD can be implemented in 2 manners:

"`static`"::
Generate a single static `/etc/motd` text file and
dismantle update-motd's scripts so only this file is being shown by `pam_motd`
(traditional motd).

"`update-motd`"::
Activate the `update-motd` functionality
https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/5-update-motd/[(nicely described in Ubuntu's MAN Page)],
by which the motd is dynamically assembled from a collection of scripts
at login or periodically through the use of a `cron` job.
+
This role will delete the traditional `/etc/motd` file,
leaving only the output of the scripts to be included in the assembled motd.
+
This role will install its own `update-motd` Implementation on systems
without this functionality built into their version of `pam_motd`.
+

=== Static MOTD Configuration Variables

[source,yaml]
----
motd_static_motd_template: "issue.net"
----
Path to Ansible template ending in `.jinja2`.

[NOTE]
====
This role comes bundled with a pre-defined legal banner.
To use your own templates, ensure your template do not wear the exact names
as the one in link:templates[this roles' `templates` directory].
====

=== Dynamic MOTD Configuration Variables

[source,yaml]
----
motd_dynamic_scripts_system_packages: [OS-specific, see /defaults directory]
----
Packages to be installed by this role using
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html[Ansible's package module].

[source,yaml]
----
motd_dynamic_scripts_templates:
  - "00-legal" # in case SSH-Banner didn't show
  - "10-sysinfo"
----
Path to Ansible templates ending in `.jinja2` that are to be generated into `motd_dynamic_scripts_directory`.

[NOTE]
====
This role comes bundled with some already defined templates.
To use your own templates, ensure your templates do not wear the exact names
as the ones in link:templates[this roles' `templates` directory].
====

[source,yaml]
----
motd_dynamic_scripts_directory: [OS-specific by default, see /vars directory]
----
Path to store the templated `motd_dynamic_scripts_templates`.
Must *not* end with `/`.

[source,yaml]
----
motd_dynamic_scripts_backup: false
motd_dynamic_scripts_backup_path: "{{ motd_dynamic_scripts_directory }}-backup"
----
This role ensures that `motd_dynamic_scripts_directory`
*only* contains the files stated in `motd_dynamic_scripts_templates`.

These variables define whether and where to backup files
found in the mentioned directory that are not included in the list
of this role's defined script template names.

[source,yaml]
----
motd_static_motd_backup: false
motd_static_motd_backup_path: "/etc/motd-backup"
----
This role ensure's that only the dynamic scripts
have influence on the resulting motd.

If `/etc/motd` is found to be a normal text file,
these variables define whether and where to backup this file.


[[public_vars]]
== 📜 Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[dependencies]]
== 👫 Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== 📚 Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/default/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:

as well as the recursive tree of their soft dependencies.
